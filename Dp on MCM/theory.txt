if there are teo matrix of size x1,y1 and x2,y2 then we can multiply both matrix when
(x2 == y1) . and the cost to multiply both matrix is : x1 * x2 * y2 ;

if there are three matrix a(x1,y1) b(x2,y2) c(x3,y3) . then the cost of
multiplying { (a(x1,y1) * b(x2,y2)) * (c3,y3)  } and { a(x1,y1) * ( b(x2,y2) * (c3,y3) ) }

these type of techniques is used to do partition 
partition will not be a part of subset but in the form of subarray 

overall we have to make a cut
